# D&D Monster Fight Helper
hcde 310 final project

This program helps users learn basic information about a specific monster without giving away numeric values. This program is designed for players of D&D 5e that want to learn more about a creature, but don't want to spoil a fight. This resource is also valuable to new players or game masters who don't exactly understand what any numbers mean, and as such the vague descriptors this program provides would be invaluable.
